# Modernization Roadmap

This document outlines the modernization efforts being applied to the SWS Extension.

## Project Goals

The Modern SWS Extension aims to enhance the user experience of the original SWS Extension by introducing contemporary interface design patterns while maintaining full backward compatibility and the powerful functionality that users depend on.

## Current Status

### Completed

- **Project Foundation** (Task 1)
  - Created modern UI component architecture
  - Implemented theme management system with automatic dark/light detection
  - Built icon management system with caching
  - Established base classes for modern rendering

### In Progress

- **Modern Playlist UI** - Redesigning the Region Playlist window with:
  - Enhanced visual feedback for current and next items
  - Improved status indicators and progress visualization
  - Better hover states and interaction feedback
  - Accessibility improvements with proper contrast ratios

### Planned

- Additional UI modernizations across other SWS components
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced keyboard navigation
- Improved accessibility features

## Design Principles

1. **Maintain Compatibility**: All existing functionality must continue to work exactly as before
2. **Respect User Preferences**: Adapt to REAPER's theme and user settings
3. **Improve Accessibility**: Ensure proper contrast ratios and clear visual hierarchy
4. **Optimize Performance**: Use efficient rendering and caching strategies
5. **Professional Aesthetics**: Apply modern design patterns without sacrificing functionality

## Technical Approach

The modernization is being implemented through:

- New rendering classes that extend existing components
- Theme-aware color management
- Efficient icon generation and caching
- Modular architecture that allows gradual enhancement
